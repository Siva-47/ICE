## Requirements

The code are mainly written with R (version 4.0.3). The following R packages are required and can be installed directly in R:

- load and process data
  - data.table
  - igraph
- speed the computation
  - Rfast 
  - Matrix
- visualize the results
  - ggplot2 
  - pheatmap
  - viridisLite

```setup
install.packages('data.table')
```

## Methods

We list all the methods we discuss in the dictionary **Methods**, including our proposed method (ICE), and
[neighborhood averaging method (NS)](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/pubs/Zhang-Biometrika17.pdf) proposed by
Zhang et al. (2017),
[universal singular value thresholding algorithm (USVT)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1247.pdf) (Chatterjee et al., 2015)
and neighborhood averaging using true neighbors (Oracle).
To reproduce the results in the paper, you should run the code in all the files
in this dictionary first.

The other two methods, [stochastic blockmodel approximation algorithm (SBA)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2013/file/b7b16ecf8ca53723593894116071700c-Paper.pdf) (Airoldi et al., 2013), [sorting and smoothing method (SAS)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stanleychan/files/chan_airoldi_2014_0.pdf) (Chan and Airoldi, 2014)
are provided by Chan and Airoldi (2014) and written with Matlab.
We place the codes in dictionary **simulation/SAS_SBA**.

## Application

The file **application.R** provides an example about how to use our proposed method (ICE) with a given network, including some necessary details, like 
how to stop the iterations and select appropriate tuning parameters.

Mark: To generate the simulated network, the code in the file **simulation/network_generate.R** should be runned first.

## Simulation

To evaluate our method on simulated networks and compare it with NS, USVT and Oracle, run **simulation/network_generate.R** and **simulation/simulation.R**.

The dictionary **simulation/data** includes the network data generated, which can be used as the inputs for methods written with Matlab (SAS and SBA). 

The dictionary **simulation/result** includes the results. We have store the data and results on Graphon 1 with 3 repetitions as an example.

To get the performance of SAS and SBA on the same networks, run **simulation/SAS_SBA/simulation_SAS_SBA.m**.

## Real Data Analysis

You can download pretrained models here:
